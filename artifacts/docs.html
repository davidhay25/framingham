<h3>Purpose</h3>

To support a FHIR connectathon, and record the results.

<h3>Using</h3>

To use the Manager, follow these steps.

<div style="margin-left: 12px">
<h4>Register</h4>
There are a number of registration steps to perform (some of which may have already been done for you).
<ul>
    <li>See if you have already been added as a 'Person' in the 'People tab. If not, then add yourself using the 'new Person link.
        You might also want to check and possibly update the data there.
        Once you've done this, you can then be associated with a client or a server, and a summary will appear in the people tab. </li>
    <li>Next, add any clients or servers that you have using the Client or Server tab. For a client you add the name of the client (which must be unique), a description, and yourself as the contact. A Server is similar, except that you add the URL to the server root, and click the 'check' button to retrieve the CapabilityStatement (which is required of all FHIR servers).</li>
    <li>Finally, for any Client/Server scenarios that you intend to participate in, add your client or server to the appropriate
    scenario in the 'Testing' tab (using the Client/Server subtab).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Record</h4>
At any stage, you can record the outcome of a test - or just make a note against a scenario. There are a number ways to do this.


<ul>
    <li>For a Client/Server interaction, use the Testing tab (where you registered your Client or Server in the previous step).
        There is a link at the intersettion of the Client and Server where the details can be entered. The data that can be entered
        includes:
        <ul>
            <li>The person entering the result (the Asserter). This is an auto-complete picklist from the registered people </li>
            <li>The outcome of the test. Options are Pass, Fail, Partial and Note (The latter used when no test was actually
            performed, but some notes want to be registered</li>
            <li>A general comments field</li>
            <li>Tracker items made as a result of the test. There is a link to GForge (where trackers are entered), and the
            tracker is entered directly into GForge, and the URL pasted manually back to the form</li>
        </ul>
        There can only be a single result for any combination of Client & Server, but it can be edited. Note that there is no
        security applied - anyone can make any change.
    </li>
    <li>There is also a 'Scenario Direct' option. This is similar to the above, except that there is no Client or Server,
    and is intended to allow ah-hoc notes to be made, or more complex interactions described.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Report</h4>

<ul>

    <li>Finally, view (and download) the results in the Results tab.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<h3>Structure</h3>

The tracks are defined as follows:

<br/>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <img src="/artifacts/structure.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
        Each track has have any number of scenarios, each of which has any number of roles. (Note that for this event all of the scenarios have all of the roles, as this is how the data has been captured in the spreadsheets)

    </div>
</div>




<br/>


<h3>Testing</h3>


<br/>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <img src="/artifacts/test.png"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
        Each test has 2 participants - a client in a role, and a server in a role.
        (This is not a limit of the underlying structure - simply the User Interface at the moment).
        The data collected for the outcome of the test is:

        <br/><br/>
        <ul>
            <li>The person who is asserting the outcome of the test</li>
            <li>Pass, Fail or Partial</li>
            <li>An optional note for any other information </li>
        </ul>

        The test results can be viewed and edited in the Scoring tab, and summarized in the Results tab. There is also a download option in the Results tab.
    </div>

<h3>Tabs</h3>
The following tabs are present:

<ul>
    <li><em>Documentation</em></li>
    <li><em>Track Descriptions</em>. A display that shows tracks, scenarios and roles as described above.</li>
    <li><em>People</em>. All the people participating in the event. Each Client and Server has a person associated with them (currently one only) and this association (plus the scenario associations) forms the basis of the summary for each person found on this page.
    <li><em>Clients</em>. All the registered Clients (including person contact).</li>
    <li><em>Servers</em>. All the registered Servers (including person contact).</li>
    <li><em>Testing</em>. Allows Clients and Servers to be associated with a scenario (each in a particular role) and for the outcome of the interaction to be recorded.</li>
    <li><em>Result</em>s. Various displays of the outcomes of testing (as entered in the scoring tab).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Summary tab shows a pie chart giving the outcomes against each scenario</li>
        <li>The Details tab lists the details of all the outcomes, and provides an option to download the results as a JSON file.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Known limitations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only 2 participants (Client and Server) for each test</li>
    <li>Can't edit the track contents (Track, Scenario & Roles). These are currently configuration files that need to be manually updated.</li>
</ul>
