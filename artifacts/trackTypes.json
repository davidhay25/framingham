  {"lmreview":"A Logical Model Review track is designed for Clinicians to review and comment on a single Logical Model. This might be a model that constrains a base resource type, and is intended to become a profile, or a multi-resource model like a Document. The Logical Model needs to be created by the clinFHIR Logical Modeller.",
  "scenario":"The Scenario track is intended for Clincians and those new to FHIR. It is intended as an educational track, but can also be used to determine which resource types are needed to represent a given scenario. Both core resource types and Logical Models (constraining a core resource type) may be used.",
"technical": "A technical track is similar to a classic IHE Connectathon. It assumes that the participants are developers who are exchanging information between (at least) 2 systems - a Client and a Server -   to meet the requirements of the scenarios defined by the track."}
